# Multiclass-classification-model-using-CNN

Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.


The data set contains the following diseases:

Actinic keratosis
Basal cell carcinoma
Dermatofibroma
Melanoma
Nevus
Pigmented benign keratosis
Seborrheic keratosis
Squamous cell carcinoma
Vascular lesion


Conclusion:

----> Findings :

Both training and validation accuracy increase with training.
Training & validation losses both decrease over training time.
There is not much difference between training and validation accuracy, hence, the problem of overfitting is no longer there.
Both training and validation accuracy are much better than the previous models.
Hence, handling class imbalance and introducing batch normalization and dropouts have increased accuracy as well as removed overfitting upto an extent.
